# QuoridorX - A PyQt6-Powered Quoridor Game

QuoridorX is a desktop implementation of the classic **Quoridor** board game built using **PyQt6**. The game features two modes of play: **1v1 multiplayer** or **player vs bot**, with adjustable AI difficulty levels ranging from *easy* to *impossible*. QuoridorX offers an intuitive user interface, smooth gameplay, and robust AI for solo play, making it an ideal game for both casual players and competitive strategists.

## üéÆ Features

### 1. **Two Modes of Play**
   - **Multiplayer Mode (1v1)**: Play against another human player locally on the same device.
   - **Single Player Mode (vs AI)**: Challenge yourself against the bot with four different AI difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, and impossible).

### 2. **AI-Driven Opponent**
   - **Intelligent Pathfinding**: The AI leverages algorithms like BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) to calculate optimal moves and paths.
   - **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: The AI's decision-making is powered by the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, allowing it to plan strategically and anticipate player moves, especially in the harder difficulties.
   - **Difficulty Levels**: The AI adapts to different levels of challenge, from simple and predictable moves at the easiest difficulty to complex, tactical gameplay at the "impossible" level, where wall placements and move predictions are optimized.

### 3. **Smooth User Interface**
   - The game interface is built using **PyQt6**, offering a visually appealing and responsive experience.
   - Players are represented with distinctive avatars, and the game provides real-time visual feedback like turn indicators and wall counts.
   - Features a **9x9 grid** where players can move their pawns and strategically place walls to block the opponent‚Äôs path.

### 4. **Wall Placement Mechanics**
   - Each player has 10 walls to strategically place on the board to hinder the opponent's progress.
   - Intelligent wall placements are essential in higher difficulties, where the AI prioritizes blocking the player‚Äôs shortest path and finding the most advantageous moves.

### 5. **Game Flow and Turn Management**
   - The game ensures smooth management of turns and game states, including visual effects for active players and winner announcements.
   - The bot adapts to changing situations, with its moves dynamically adjusting based on the board configuration and player's actions.

### 6. **Pathfinding Optimizations**
   - The game features optimized pathfinding with caching to speed up gameplay, reducing the need for repetitive calculations, especially when walls are placed or removed.

## üíª Technologies

- **PyQt6**: For creating the main user interface, including the window layout, buttons, and grid-based game board.
- **Python**: Core logic for gameplay, AI algorithms, and pathfinding.
- **BFS & DFS Pathfinding Algorithms**: Efficient pathfinding for both player and AI movements.
- **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: AI decision-making for optimal moves in competitive play.
- **QGraphicsView & QGraphicsScene**: Used to render and manage game items (players, walls) on the board.
- **Custom Bot Integration**: Bot implementation with varying difficulty based on pathfinding, decision-making, and strategy.

## üöÄ How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Choose between 1v1 multiplayer or play against the bot.
2. **Select AI Difficulty**: If you choose to play against the bot, you can select the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, or Impossible).
3. **Gameplay**: Move your pawn across the 9x9 board, aiming to reach the opposite side while blocking your opponent with walls.
4. **Win the Game**: The first player to reach the opposite side of the board wins!
